She needs some extra TLC as she acclimates to her new surroundings and people, especially men. But, once she is comfortable (take about a week), she is just a lovebug! They are currently in a foster home but will need a new foster or forever home in about a week. They play well together, are crate and leash trained. They are not particularly energetic dogs but should be walked twice daily.  They would enjoy a yard, and would be great hiking/camping buddies. Kids over six are good, no cats, small dogs or other small animals in the home.",

Iâ€™m not the friendliest with men at first but can learn to accept just about anyone after while.

He also has a very healthy appetite. He needs lots of exercise and would perhaps be perfect for a young, athletic individual with a lot of patience. Though Toby has had experience living with at least two dogs in the home, we would recommend that he be the focus of all of your attention as your only dog. He has a lot of love to give, and would require a lot of your attention. He has beautiful blue eyes and a double coat, specific to pomskies. He has a bit more of the Husky genes in him, judging from his size, but is playful like a Pomeranian. If Toby seems like he'd be a great fit in your home, please don't hesitate to reach out!",
